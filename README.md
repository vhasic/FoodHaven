You can watch a short [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-EgIt3SDBW6yYzzpO6I4CTE_VMV1Lt5j/view?usp=sharing) of project functionalities. The video shows all the features on the frontend and some backend features. 

Project documentation can be foud [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P8b4Ih3AcqPpqYLbeKDi9-ZvmdJqO8oW/edit).

## Backend (Microservices)
The project consists of following four main microservices:
- [User service](/user-service)
- [Recipe service](/project-service)
- [Rating service](/rating-service)
- [Ingredient service](/ingredient-service)

Alongside those, there are 4 utility microservices: 
- [Configuration service](/configuration-service) - for centralizing the configuration files for other services
- [Eureka server](/eureka-server) - load balancer
- [System events service](/system-events-service) - for in-app logging of all activities
- [Gateway service](/api-gateway) - a single-point entry for the backend

## Web Application
This project consists of a web application that showcases the functionalities developed on the backend. The web application is developed using React framework and you can find the source code [in this folder](/frontend). 

## Startup
You can run the application utilizing the docker setup. In order to do so, follow the next steps:
- Make sure you have **docker** installed
- Navigate to the root of the project
- Projects must be built by typing: ``./mvnw package -Dmaven.test.skip=true`` in console (make sure you have at least JAVA 11 installed). 
If some project build doesn't succeed it has to be built manually.
- run ``docker-compose up `` (be aware that the first time you run this, it may take around 15 minutes to build the project)
- navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to start using the web application (make sure that ports 3000 and 8088 on your machine are free, because the app uses those ports to serve the webapp and expose the backend)
